    <p>
        I am a student with a strong interest in web development and front-end design.
        I enjoy creating clean and responsive web pages using HTML and CSS.
        I use modern layout techniques like Flexbox to organize content properly.
        I focus on building simple designs that are easy to understand and navigate.
        I pay attention to structure, alignment, and spacing while developing web pages.
        I like learning by practicing and improving my work step by step.
        I am continuously working to strengthen my skills and explore new web concepts.
        I aim to create user-friendly and well-structured websites.
